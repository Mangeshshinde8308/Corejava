//In a simple abstract meant partially implemented.
//The abstract Method is used for creating blueprints for classes or interfaces. 
//Here methods are defined but these methods donâ€™t provide the implementation. 
//Abstract Methods can only be implemented using subclasses or classes that implement the interfaces.

//To declare an abstract method, use this general form:
//abstract type method-name(parameter-list);  -->means we just declared methods. not implemented the method.
